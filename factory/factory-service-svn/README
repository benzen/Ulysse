This is service is a *proof-of-concept* demonstrating how to alternatively
integrate subversion into the factory.

Since this integration relies on a SSH command, the factory might be able to check 
authentication and access control when remote commands are invoked by svn clients
(command line, tortoise, eclipse plugin, and so one). Additionally it might be possible
to add fine grained security rules (on branches for example).
