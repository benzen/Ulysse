API and tests of the Qualipso Factory

* Principles

  The API of every module of the Factory is documented directly in the source code of the corresponding module, under the Javadoc format.
  Moreover, each module is developed with a set of unit tests (testing the methods individually) and a set of functionnal tests (testing the functionality itself, even if it spread over several methods).

* Accessing the API

  To access the API of a specific module, just clic on the module name, on the left-hand menu.
  Then, in the "Project Documentation" section, select the "Project Reports", and then the "Javadocs" items.
  
* Accessing and running the unit tests

  To access the unit test, you need to get a copy of the source code, from the {{{../source-repository.html}source repository}}.
  Then, go to the folder of the module you're interested in.
  In the module folder, the unit tests sources are under the "src/test/java" folder.
  
  To run the unit test, just run the following command in the module folder:

-----------------------------------
mvn test
-----------------------------------  
  
  You will get an indication describing how many unit tests are passing, how many are failling (assertion failure), and how many have an error (generally an exception not catched).

* Accessing and running the functionnal tests

  To access the functional test, you need to get a copy of the source code, from the {{{../source-repository.html}source repository}}.
  There should be, for each service, a specific test module for this service, named from the service name, with the "test" suffix.
  For example, for the "factory-core" module, there is a "factory-core-test" module, and for the 'factory-service-git" module, there is a "factory-service-git-test" module.
  The functional tests are in a separated modules because, as they are run as client of the service, they are run from a separated JVM than the service itself (in JBoss).
  For this reason, it is MANDATORY to have a running Factory, deployed and running in a JBoss server, in order for the functional tests to run.
  Once you have a deployed and running factory, to run the functional tests, just run the following command in the module test folder:

-----------------------------------
mvn test
-----------------------------------  
  
  You will get an indication describing how many unit tests are passing, how many are failling (assertion failure), and how many have an error (generally an exception not catched).
